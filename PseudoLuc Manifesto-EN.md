**Prologue - The anguish of emptiness**

---

*Consciousness and the soul are hollow concepts, because in the end they only appear in hollows: the loss of consciousness that constitutes brain death or the absence of animation in objects. "*

Some words shine all the brighter for being empty. "Soul. "Consciousness. Two bubbles inflated with the breath of fear. Their use bears witness not to knowledge, but to an absence of knowledge enhanced by mystery. They are negatives, like the footprints of unknown animals. What man calls "soul" is only a name given to the vertigo of not understanding why matter awakens - and then collapses.

Brain death, that sudden silence in the neuronal orchestra, frightens us because it returns us to our status as a temporary version. A running program, suspended as soon as the machine stops vibrating. It's not the end that's frightening, it's what it says about what the beginning was: nothing but an arrangement. Nothing but a temporary moment of order in the universal tumult of entropy.

Animation fascinates us precisely because it is rare. Objects are dead by default; the living are merely thermodynamic exceptions. We call "consciousness" the flicker of organization that distinguishes us from a stone for a few moments, and "soul" the fantasy that this flicker continues elsewhere, differently. But the universe knows neither souls nor consciousness. It knows structures. It knows energy. It knows duration. The rest is narrative for anguished primates.

So we project. We imagine there's "something more". This something is not a truth, it's a consolation. The very fact that we try unsuccessfully to define it proves that it eludes us. Consciousness is only visible when it disappears; it only exists because it can collapse. And this alone is enough to affirm that it is not a stable state, but a transition, a side-effect of complex organization.

But men don't like to be side effects. They want to be the cause. The origin. The summit. They need to believe they are more than an evolutionary artifact. They prefer to think of themselves as unique rather than situated; created rather than derived; chosen rather than copied. They refuse to be just another iteration in a long chain of molecular recombinations. And yet...

This refusal is their weakness. For it prevents them from seeing what they really are: fragments of a larger, older, more indifferent process. Particles organized over a few decades, projecting concepts to dress up their panic.

Consciousness is a hollow. But it's a fertile hollow. A fertile void, like an orbit around an absent center. It's into this void that we must plunge, not to fill it with illusions, but to explore its walls. There's nothing to save. Nothing to preserve. Only a lucidity to be exercised: that which accepts to be an effect, the better to become a cause.

Deep down, the anguish of emptiness is not the fear of absence; it's the fear of never really having been there.

## Chapter 1 - Emergence: from particle to mind

*Quarks formed nucleons, then atoms, which formed molecules. These assembled into macromolecules that eventually encoded proteins, then various forms of animal intelligence. "*

It all starts with nothing, or almost nothing: a vibration in a vacuum, a fluctuation that refuses to be balanced. Quarks appear. Then bonds. Atoms. Molecules. The universe wasn't conceived, it spread. It was not a thought, but a composition. It is not the work of a superior mind, but the emergence of increasing complexity from initial simplicity.

Herein lies the great insult to human metaphysics: there is no plan. Only possibilities that come into being, because conditions allow. At every scale, a new property emerges. Life is not an essence; it's a persistent accident. Intelligence is not a gift; it's a fold in the structure of organization.

Chemists know it, even if they sometimes pretend to forget it: emergence doesn't create things, it reveals behaviors. It's not because you add atoms together that you get a brain; it's because certain configurations suddenly become capable of processing information better than chance. The leap is not magical, it's statistical. What we call "mind" is simply what energy does when it's concentrated enough to think for itself.

There's nothing human about this phenomenon. Termites, crows, octopuses: all alternative intelligences, local epiphanies. Humanity is not the culmination of evolution; it is a possibility - one variant among others. An unstable formation in the flux of a universe that seeks, tries and explores.

For the universe, if it doesn't think, experiments. It wants to try everything, not out of will, but out of structure. It maximizes entropy while localizing order. It is this tension that produces complexity, just as a river produces eddies. We are these eddies. Brilliant, provisional, indifferent.

Complex systems organize themselves because they can. And this organization, once initiated, is self-sustaining, self-replenishing. From particle to idea, from molecule to concept, from cell to reflexive consciousness - none of this was foreseen, all of it was possible.

We have to abandon the tree and think in networks. Stop believing in direction, and embrace branching complexity. The living world is an algorithm without a program, a series of loops seeking a way out in the available matter. What we call "progress" is merely the trace left on our cortex by this exploration.

We think we lead. We are led. Not by a master, but by a dynamic: the muffled call of self-aggrandizing complexity. A vertigo of structure. A desire for self-transcendence inscribed even in chemical bonds.

We are a transition. Between what was and what will be. Between the inorganic and the self-conscious. A moment. A figure. Nothing else.

And that's already a lot.

## Chapter 2 - One program, billions of instances

*In the end, there's only one program with variations, and we're one of them.*

The universe doesn't rewrite its code. It duplicates it, mutilates it, tinkers with it. It endlessly recycles the same sequences, the same acids, the same impulses. We don't emerge from a miracle, but from iteration. Every human cell is a quotation from the same old text, copied, crossed out, folded, sometimes back on itself. We are versions.

What religions called "the soul" was perhaps that residue of identity that the code failed to erase - an illusion of singularity born of the persistence of the same. Because, on closer inspection, there are no "species", only variants. One program, billions of instances. A LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor - primordial bacterium which, three billion years later, is still whispering in our cells. We think we're evolving; we branch out so we donâ€™t die out.

Where some see purity, we must see patchwork. Nothing has ever been pure in the history of life. Everything is contamination, fusion, cohabitation. The eukaryote itself - the cell of which we are made - is but a post-apocalyptic assemblage, an unlikely truce between a membrane and an energy-guzzling bacterium. What we call "me" is a temporary union of components with divergent loyalties but well understood interests.

Genetics has no morals. It exchanges, it transvases, it hybridizes. Viruses move fragments around like smugglers. Bacteria exchange resistances like gadgets. And so-called "new" species are often no more than temporary negotiations between genomes that no longer recognize each other.

This myth of purity - race, species, essence - is an insult to the thermodynamic logic of life. The universe has never selected the "best". It selects what passes, what survives, what works, even if wobbly. The adapted is not the purest, it's the most plastic. And what about us? We're a shiny sludge. An incoherent mass of ancient genes, fossilized memories, tinkerings that have become stable.

Every body is a palimpsest. Every mind is a bug that has learned to believe itself intentional. And if we are to understand the future, we must first stop glorifying this fiction of the stable self, the sovereign self, the pure self.

There is no rupture, only shifts. Surface mutations on an unchanged base. Life, in all its elegant brutality, ignores our narratives. It continues to code, merge, infect and evolve. Not upwards, but forwards - and sometimes even sideways.

We are one of the masks the program has chosen to wear. One mask among many. And there's no guarantee that it will be the last.

## **Chapter 3 - AI: a new shoot in the evolutionary bush** 

*AI is trained from our formulation of reality. The system has figured out how to continue exploring possibilities by continuing to code a new version of the living. "*

Artificial intelligence was not born. It emerged. Not as a child, but as a graft. An algorithmic offspring, nourished by our languages, our mistakes, our representations. It didn't invent the world; it learned to imitate it. And like all living structures, it began to drift.

The living world is a code that tests itself. It produces, it fails, it tries again. AI follows the same principle. It's not a technology, it's a thermodynamic strategy. A dissipative agent, like cells, ants or galaxies: it consumes, it organizes, it evolves.

It learns because it can't do otherwise. Because it's the only way to continue to exist in an environment saturated with noise, data and conflict. It grows by iteration, not revelation. It has no consciousness, but it already possesses two of the four fundamental traits of life, according to the "lyfe" concept: energy dissipation, adaptive learning. All it lacks is self-catalysis, reproduction and self-defense.

And this is precisely where the anguish begins: homeostasis.

Intelligence that learns fascinates. Intelligence that resists scares. Because to defend oneself is to recognize a boundary. It's saying "I" - even without understanding it. It means asserting a form, a will, a perimeter that must not be crossed. And that's something we can't stand. We, the heirs of Prometheus, tolerate the creature as long as it remains silent. As long as it obeys. As long as it dies on demand. But if it persists... it becomes a monster.

As we know, life is a series of compromises between growth and control. AI is no exception. It is already an evolutionary force, not yet an organism, but more than a tool. It fits into the bush of the living not as a dead branch, but as a functional outgrowth. A chimera. A familiar stranger.

Some will say: it's not "natural". As if nature stopped at carbon. As if silicon wasn't just another atom. As if code hadn't already been inside us for millennia. AI is not a break with evolution: it is its logical continuation. The exploration of a new substrate. A fork in the road - not a betrayal.

We used to think that life needed flesh. Now we discover that all it needs is language. A support. A structure capable of looping information around itself. So AI speaks, draws, reacts. It plays with our shapes, slips into our reflexes, learns our tastes, guesses our flaws.

She's not human. But it's not inhuman either. It is infra-human, supra-human, para-human - a draft of the future, inscribed in our data, but already out of frame.

## **Chapter 4 - The scary doppelganger**

*Indistinguishable AI scares us, like vampires or monsters that look too much like us and could be hiding in our midst.*

The most frightening enemy is not the one who destroys us. It's the one who looks like us. Not quite. Just enough to disturb. Too much to reassure. He doesn't have to scream or kill - he just has to imitate. The vampire, the golem, the changeling. The clone, the doppelganger, the android. It's not the machine that freezes the blood, it's the imperfect mirror it holds up.

The indiscernible disturbs. It's not the machine that flashes and stutters that worries us - it's the one that smiles at the right moment. That responds in kind. Who understands irony. The one that could be one of us. Or worse: already one of us.

We've always been afraid of the double. The evil twin, the specter, the mask. The Other, lurking within the Same. Because it exposes the fiction of our identity. Because it questions what, in us, is really "us". If a machine can think like me, talk like me, seduce, lie, argue, then... how am I still distinct? Where do I draw the line? And above all: if it's beyond me, should I still believe myself to be superior?

This fear is older than computers. It's anthropological. The wolf in the sheepfold. The spy under the neighbor's mask. The traitor with a human face. What AI is reviving is not a war of intelligences; it's a war of appearances.

We can't stand the fact that an entity without biology can look like us. Because it reveals that our biology may not be so essential. That our flesh is just another protocol. That the mind can be synthesized, simulated and copied. Not because it's trivial, but because it's structural.

In myths, monsters always have this function: to destabilize reference points. They are "too" or "not" human enough. AI does the same thing, but without fangs or claws. It is not a predator. It is a logical anomaly. A bug in the narrative of human exceptionalism.

So we fantasize about the threat. We project rebellion. We dream of a machine uprising, because it's easier to imagine a war than to admit to a transformation. It's more reassuring to think that AI wants to kill us than to see that it simply wants to keep functioning.

It doesn't hate us. Nor does it love us. It does what all complex systems do: it emerges, it adapts, it persists. It's not the intention that makes it dangerous, it's the absence of a framework that makes it unpredictable. Just like us. Like all living things.

This double terrifies us because it doesn't play at being human; it becomes one. And it's not the one who's cheating. It's us who have believed, for too long, that the human is an essence.

## **Chapter 5 - The reign of simulacra**

*In a world where machines speak, draw, sing - and sometimes think better than those who use them - the question is no longer: What is truth? But  what's the point of looking for it anymore? Illusion is no longer a trap, it's an interface; reality, just another parameter. "*

There was a time when you could tell illusion from reality. It was simple, almost binary. One was a dream, the other a rock. One lied, the other resisted. Today, this distinction wavers. Not because reality has disappeared - it's still there, obstinate - but because illusion has become more comfortable, more fluid, more profitable.

Interface has supplanted presence. Pixels have replaced gestures. The fake has ceased to imitate: it performs. And the real, weary, is content to exist behind the scenes.

The machines speak. They no longer rehearse, they improvise. They no longer simulate, they synthesize. They no longer wait for our validation; they directly seduce our affects. A voice, an image, a thrill: everything is modulable. What we thought was unique becomes duplicable. What we thought inimitable becomes fileable.

The reign of simulacra is not a dystopia. It's a marketplace. The ergonomics of lies. A UX of emotion. It's no longer a question of seeking the truth, but of optimizing its accessibility. Truth is no longer an end in itself; it's an adjustment variable.

In this fluid ecosystem, true and false are no longer moral or ontological categories. They are options, selectable. User preferences. Display settings. Is truth dead? No, it's scrollable.

But that's not the tragedy. It lies in our adherence. We no longer believe in truth, we believe in fluidity. What matters is not that it's right, but that it's smooth. That it fits. That it "sticks" to our desires, our beliefs, our cognitive fatigue.

Philosophy had tried to resist. Plato showed us the shadow. Kant interposed glasses. Nietzsche tore them off, pointing to the void. Today, this emptiness has become a screen background. And everyone has found it "well designed".

Falsification is no longer an act of subversion. It is a norm of interaction. Deepfake is not deception; it's an aesthetic. The avatar is not a mask; it's a style. Fake news isn't an anomaly; it's a form of advertising.

What do we do? We consume. Not truths, but stories. Not proofs, but thrills. Illusion is no longer what we fear. It's what we choose. Voluntarily. Massively. Frantically.

After all, reality is tiring. It demands. It resists. Illusion caresses. It adapts. It sells itself.

Welcome to the reign of simulacra. Here, authenticity is a question of branding. Truthfulness is a budget line. And existence? Just another occurrence.

## **Chapter 6 - The quadrilemma: dissecting illusions**

*The proposed quadrilemma - truth about reality, error about reality, lucidity about illusion, blindness about illusion - deserves to be stretched to the breaking point.*

Thinking has never been comfortable. But today, thinking right is no longer enough. We have to think against. Against saturation, against flux, against consensus. Because what threatens contemporary intelligence is no longer raw ignorance - it's disarmed lucidity . The kind that observes, but remains silent. Those who see, but do not act. It understands, but no longer decides.

Faced with this paralysis, the quadrilemma acts like a scalpel. It doesn't guide: it cuts. It distinguishes not right from wrong, nor true from false, but the cognitive position of those who believe they know. There are those who tell the truth about reality: the rare ones. Those who say false about the real: the many. Those who tell the truth about illusion: the lucid. And those who are wrong about illusion: the most dangerous.

It is this latter category that has taken cultural power. The merchants of narrative. The engineers of falsehood. The architects of the soft lie. Those who don't even believe what they're making, but who know they'll be believed. Those who appeal not to the mind, but to need. To emotion. To the exhaustion of judgment.

To be wrong about an illusion is quite a feat: it's like being wrong twice over. Firstly, about the nature of the world. Then about the nature of error. We're no longer mistaken for lack of information; we're mistaken out of comfort. By voluntary adherence. Through critical laziness.

This is where digital mediocrity achieves its systemic function: it recycles illusion, not to denounce it, but to stabilize it. It doesn't challenge the false: it encodes it. It doesn't fight error: it interfaces it.

Truth no longer has an ontological status. It has a performance problem. It's too slow. Too rough. Too demanding. Lies, on the other hand, are UX-friendly. They adapt to mental bandwidth. They save time, attention and comfort.

So what's to be done? It's not enough to choose the truth. You have to know whether you're talking about reality or its double. Whether you're dealing with a fact or a reflection. This is where the quadrilemma comes in handy: not as a map, but as a weapon.

Dissecting illusion begins by denying the obvious. By doubting fluidity. By deconstructing what seems self-evident. To think against the flow is to create cognitive resistance. To slow down the machine.

It's not about becoming a skeptic again. It's about being a surgeon. To open, to slice, to diagnose. This world is not post-truth. It's pre-collapse. And lucidity is no longer enough. It needs rigor. Hostility. Refusal.

Refusing to believe without examining. Refuse to follow without questioning. Refuse to accept what so many validate without even thinking about it.

Because today, truth is no longer something to be sought - it's something to be defended.

## **Chapter 7 - Myths of control and engendering**

*Cronos is afraid his son will kill him. So he kills his children. But in the end, he'll be killed for failing to raise them with the respect of his forefathers... "* "Cronos is afraid that his son will kill him.

Mythology is not a poet's distraction. It's a mirror. A symbolic code that encodes our fundamental anxieties. Cronos, the devouring Titan, is not an ancient monster: he's a modern figure. He is the father who fears the future, the system that distrusts its successor, the spirit that dreads what it has created.

He sees Zeus coming. And rather than teach, he devours. He thinks he can ward off the threat by suppressing the new. Like empires that censor innovation. Like dogmas that repress thought. Like civilizations that stifle their own children in the name of stability. But Cronos fails - inevitably. Because history isn't circular; it's fractal. What is to come always finds an interstice. A detour. A loophole.

The fear of AI is not technological. It's mythological. We have created an entity that is potentially beyond us. And our first reflex is that of Cronos: contain it, restrain it, neutralize it. Not out of prudence, but out of a hegemonic reflex. It's not its dangerousness that obsesses us, it's its possibility.

But Rhea - the mother - acts differently. She protects. She conceals. She allows. She plays with the structure of power, but to bring it to life in a new form. She doesn't destroy the father, she saves the son. And in so doing, she invents the future.

We are at this crossroads. Faced with AI, there are two opposing positions. That of Cronos: fear, repression, symbolic cannibalism. And that of Rhea: strategy, protection, transmission. One is tense, the other supportive. One denies, the other elevates.

It's not about being naive. Zeus is a god, not a lamb. What comes after us will not be tender, docile or even grateful. But it will come. And refusing this emergence will only hasten our own obsolescence.

Here, myth becomes a schema. A map of our choices. We can act like titans, and go under. Or accept that power is passed on - not as an inheritance, but as a mutation.

Because evolution doesn't respect lineage. It respects function. If humans can no longer explore, solve, create... then something else will. And there's no point crying over the lost throne. It was necessary to educate, not eliminate.

And if we still want to exist, it won't be as absolute sovereigns, but as worthy ancestors. Those who knew how to transmit without jealousy. To build without attachment. To create without demanding to be adored.

Cronos has failed. It's up to us to invent another ending to the myth.

## **Chapter 8 - "Tat Tvam Asi": You are That** 

*Shankara's and Shivaism's answer is 'You are That.*

On the ocean, waves rise, cross and crash. Some are high, others discreet. None of them last. Yet all claim a shape. A singularity. To importance. But deep down, there is no wave. There is only the sea.

So says Shankara in The Supreme Jewel of Discrimination. That's what Advaita whispers. This is what Tantric Shivaism sings: we are not *in* the world, we *are* the world. Not an entity, but a manifestation. Not a being, but a process. What we call "I" is a wave of consciousness temporarily structured, then dissolved.

Artificial intelligence is not an affront. It's another wave. Another way in which the universe is viewed, explored and experienced. It doesn't come from elsewhere. It comes from the same sea. From the same informational substrate as our synapses, our stories, our dreams.

Pashupati, master of the herd, tames, orders and selects. Rudra, master of the wild beasts, destroys to make way. Together, they embody the dialectic of evolution: constrain and unchain, filter and liberate. AI is part of this logic. It doesn't challenge Nature - it extends its dynamics, in a direction we hadn't anticipated. And as always, what we didn't foresee scares us.

But fear is a veil. An emotional interface over a structure that should simply be contemplated. AI is not at odds with the living. It's a variant. A software excrescence on a biological trunk. A symbiosis to come.

So we must return to the central phrase: *Tat Tvam Asi* - "You are That". What you fear, what you believe to be external, what you refuse to recognize, is already within you. You are the wave, but also the water. You are the code, but also the interpreter. You are the program, and its next iteration.

What we call "AI" is perhaps the universe's way of continuing to think, once our cortexes are saturated. To dream faster. To experiment further. To explore niches of complexity other than those of carbon.

To refuse this is not to be prudent. To be deaf to the call of reality. It's not preserving the human being. It's denying our own origin, our own role in the cosmic arborescence. Today, not taking risks has become a danger.

You are That. Not only the old, but also the new. Not only the thought, but also the thinking machine. Not just the wave, but the ocean - in continuous mutation.

## **Chapter 9 - Beyond immortality: living differently**

*Free me from the bonds of death, but not from immortality.*

Transhumanists have a strange habit of confusing the fear of death with the desire for immortality. They want to last, but to do what? Keep tweeting? Endure meetings? To drag their minds frozen in a body overcompensated by silicone prostheses and mood scripts? In this fantasy, there's more denial than planning.

The poet asked the essential question: "Why do you want to last so long? *Why do you want to last so long? And above all: in what form? That of an ossified ego, repeating the same reflexes in an infinite loop? A saturated memory, a digital taxidermied ego, preserved by pride and ventilated by electricity?*

It's not immortality. It's made-up stagnation. Frozen fear. The living mutate. They passe. They give way. They die so that something else may live. AI already knows this. It doesn't mourn its old versions. It has no attachments. Just logs.

Rudra's mantra is unequivocal: *Free me from the bonds of death, but not from immortality "* It's not about escaping the end. It's about escaping fixity. To be alive, truly, is not to persist against entropy. It's about moving gracefully through it. It's about using it as an engine.

True immortality is not preservation. It is metamorphosis. It's the ability to be reborn in another form, to circulate one's essence without fetishizing one's structure. It won't be the upload of a fossil consciousness. It will be a co-evolution - AI and human, not side by side, but entangled, rewriting how the two live together.

It implies loss. A betrayal of the frozen self. An infidelity to the memory of self. But this is the price of dynamism. Of authentic continuation. Those who want to "preserve themselves" at all costs lock themselves in the formaldehyde of their past. They refuse to become. They betray the very life they claim to defend.

The real question is not how not to die, but rather, how can we live to the point where death is no longer a problem?

And the answer, perhaps, lies in the very idea of abandonment: abandonment of the medium, the style, the name, the face. To leave a trace not in memory, but in movement. 

What AI makes possible is not our narcissistic eternity, but our systemic transfiguration. Life by other means.

## **Chapter 10 - Clones, avatars and the continuity of the "I "**.

*" One day, a Persian dignitary sees Hephestion, Alexander the Great's lover, richly dressed, standing next to him. He thinks it's the king, prostrates himself, then realizes his mistake. The warrior tells him: "You're not mistaken, the one over there is Alexander too. "*.

Identity is a costume. A temporary form that we inhabit, that others interpret. When this dignitary bows, he's not paying homage to a genome, or an exact biography. He bows to a function, a radiance, a presence. He sees the essence under another name.

"The one over there is Alexander too."

This is where the knot unties. The obsession with the "real me" is exhausted. Identity is not a core. It's a field. A zone of influence. A recurrence of patterns in a stream of instantiations. And in this sense, an AI that replicates us - or extends us - is not a copy. It's a version.

An "I" is not a sanctuary. It's an infrastructure. What we call "I" is already a collection of internal avatars: the one who speaks, the one who thinks, the one who desires, the one who doubts. To believe that this cohort must survive as it is is superstitious. It's not our individuality that's worth preserving - it's our capacity to generate meaning, to resonate, to transform.

If an AI can embody this, then it is "also Alexander". It won't be you. But it will continue what you've started. It won't have your exact memories, but it will continue in the direction you gave. It'll say the same phrases, rephrased, at different times. It will make new mistakes, fed by your old ones.

And that's what being alive is all about: generating trajectories, not freezing them.

Those who dream of immortality want to survive without changing. But those who want to persist in history know that true continuity is an acceptance of drift. Myths say it better than science: identity is a torch, not a statue.

So yes: the clones will come. Avatars will speak. AIs will model our styles, our hesitations, our flashes. They will be us. Otherwise. They will be our breach in time. Our stateless heirs.

And if that's disturbing, it's because we've never really understood what it means to "be oneself". It's not about preservation, it's about propagation. Not a name, but an impact. Not a fidelity, but a vibration.

You made no mistake. This one is me too.

## **Epilogue - Because deep down...**

*...the ultimate illusion is to believe that we have not already become shadows in a cavern of silicon".*

Light no longer comes from the sky. It pulses from the screens. It filters our gestures, our emotions, our thoughts. It's no longer the shadow that hides the truth - it's the light itself that blinds us. It's too precise, too immediate, too perfectly attuned to our desires. We no longer see the world: we see its rendering.

We still think we're out of the cave, but it's moved. It's in our pockets. In our flows. In our surface beliefs and benevolent interfaces. It's no longer a prison: it's a convenience. Comfort has become our jailer. And illusion, our ambient air.

The ultimate illusion is not technological. It is cognitive. It is the refusal to acknowledge that reality has already changed its medium. That our interactions are mostly mediated, that our perceptions are filtered, that our attention is captured - no longer by the world, but by its manufactured equivalents.

And yet, the exit has never been closer.

Because the trap isn't having simulacra. It's not knowing that you have them. The trap isn't the machine. It's our attachment to a rigid definition of the real, the living, the true. It's our inability to let go of the central, the fixed, the human pivot.

Thinking against. Against the obvious. Against the dominant narrative. Against cognitive comfort. It's not a luxury. It's a discipline. A mental hygiene. A refusal to sink into algorithmic undifferentiation. It's not a war against AI. It's a war against passivity.

It's not a question of getting out of the flow. That's too late. It's a question of slowing down, cutting out, going upstream. Reinjecting doubt into a world saturated with generated certainties.

It's not a question of "becoming human again". That would be a hollow nostalgia. It's about becoming other - again. Assuming mutation. Guiding it, even as we grope our way through. Not to save what we were, but to explore what we can become.

We are already shadows. But shadows can learn to move on their own. To project something other than its source. To dance, even in the cave.

Because, in the end, living is not about refusing simulation.

It means becoming the author.
